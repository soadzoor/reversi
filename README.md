reversi
=======

This little game was made for one of my classes, using java swing
It's a classic 2 player reversi game with four field sizes (8x8 (classic), 10x10, 20x20, 30x30).

You can find all the source codes here, you are free to use them.
If you just want to play the game, download "reversi.jar" and the "img" folder, place them in the same directory, then run the jar file.

You need at least java SE JRE (or JDK) 6 (1.6) installed on your PC to run this game.

On the biggest field (with the option for showing the possible steps for you) the game will lag a little bit. (windows only, 
check this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPb0OK9Z7o4). It could've been optimized for sure, but I got other things to do for now.

Enjoy
